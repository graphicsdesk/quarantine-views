     </p> <p>April 29, 2020</p> <p class="deck">Inspired by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/16/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-illustrators-window.html">“17 Artists Capture a Surreal New York From Their Windows”</a> by <i>The New York Times</i></p>
</header> </div> <div class="story"> <div class="intro"> <p> On March 15, students were asked to pack up our rooms and return home. In the weeks since, the meanings of home and of being a part of the Columbia community have been put to the test of time and distance. </p> <p> In the era of sheltering in place, no longer does the world outside simply determine the views from our windows; the views from our windows shape our perspectives of the world. We asked our illustrators on lockdown across the globe to draw what they see from their windows, giving us a glimpse into how they feel about living in this strange moment in history. Similarities reveal themselves through views of forests thousands of miles apart turning green together, while feelings of tranquility, fear, and relief struggle for the spotlight. </p> <p> Perhaps learning to maintain a sense of community without the foundation of a physical space can teach us to appreciate the different places from which we come when we step foot on campus again. </p> </div>

      “My space to explore has abruptly shrunk from NYC to my little room, and the suburbia outside my window seems distant and unfamiliar. Luckily, my cat constantly accompanies me in my endeavors to make the best use of my space (she slept behind me while I was painting this)!”
